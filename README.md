# pyHiM

pyHiM is a software package developed by the [Nollmann Lab](http://www.nollmannlab.org) at the [Center of Structural Biology](http://www.cbs.cnrs.fr), a department of the [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr) and the [INSERM](http://www.inserm.fr). 
pyHiM implements the analysis of multiplexed DNA-FISH data, as described in our [protocols paper](https://github.com/NollmannLab/HiM_protocol).

pyHiM was entirely written in python and makes extensive use of the following packages:

- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [starDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist)

pyHiM also uses functions from [Big-FISH](https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish) to perform Gaussian 3D fits.
