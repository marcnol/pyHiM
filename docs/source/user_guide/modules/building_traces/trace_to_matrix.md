# trace_combinator

*The objective of trace_combinator is to combine traces from different ROIs or different experiments.*

- This script takes JSON file with folders where datasets are stored.
- It searches for Trace files with the expected methods, loads them, and
- combines them into a single table that is outputed to the buildPWDmatrix folder.

## Invoke

`trace_combinator` can be run from the command line in two manners: 

- Provide input parameters in a `folders2Load.json` dictionary (see example below) at execution folder or at a `rootFolder` provided as argument. The script will read ALL the `Trace` files in the paths  provided in `folders2Load.json` and will combine them into a unique  `Trace_` files. 
  The output of `trace_combinator` will be generated at the `rootFolder` in the directory `combined_traces` that will contain a new `Trace` file with the combined traces.

  <u>*warning*</u>: `trace_combinator` will combine **ALL** traces found in the `buildPWDmatrix` folders within `folders2load.json`. If you want to filter which *Trace* files are used, we recommend you to use the second method described below. Alternatively, you can use the `--method` command-line argument to filter which `Trace` files are used. In that case, make sure to verify the terminal output to ensure the right `Trace` files have been used.

- An alternative way to use `trace_combinator` is to use pipes. In this case, a list of `Trace` files to process is piped into `trace_combinator` and the `--pipe` argument is invoked. Piping can be either done using a command or by sending a list in a file. See examples below.

  

  Example 1: using `ls`

  ```sh
  # use ls to select which files you want to combine
  $ ls folder1/Trace*3D*6.ecsv
  folder1/Trace_3D_barcode_KDtree_ROI:6.ecsv  folder1/Trace_3D_barcode_mask:DAPI_ROI:6.ecsv  folder1/Trace_3D_barcode_mask:mask0_ROI:6.ecsv
  
  # then pipe these files into trace_combinator
  $ ls folder1/Trace*3D*6.ecsv | trace_combinator --pipe
  ```

  this will process the three `Trace` files listed using `ls`.

  

  Example 2: using cat

  ```sh
  # first make list of files to process and write it in a file
  $ cat files_to_combine 
  folder1/Trace_3D_barcode_KDtree_ROI:15.ecsv
  folder2/Trace_3D_barcode_KDtree_ROI:6.ecsv
  
  # then pipe these files into trace_combinator
  $ cat files_to_combine | trace_combinator --pipe
  ```

  this will process the files within `files_to_combine`.



**Use `trace_combinator` to select traces with specific *labels***

`trace_combinator` can also be used to combine traces with specific, user-provided  `labels`, which can be attributed using `trace_selector` (see above). These can be indicated by using the `--label` command-line argument. In addition, you need to indicate whether you want to use only the traces that contain the label (`labeled`), the traces that <u>do not</u> contain the label (`unlabeled`), or all the traces (`all`) irrespective of whether they contain or not the label. It is good practice to verify the `label` column of your output `Trace_` file to check that you selected the expected traces.
