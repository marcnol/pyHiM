# filter_localizations

## Invoke
Inside the folder with your input data, run:
```shell
pyhim -C filter_localizations
```

There are several filters:

1. Properties of 2D localization algorithm (e.g. brightness)

2. Accuracy of 3D localization: sigma of fit, correlation between z-position from weighted moment and from gaussian fit, etc

3. Accuracy of drift correction in the region where the barcode was localized. 

   This is only applied if LocalDrift correction was **not** run. 

## Inputs

## Relevant options

Parameters to run this script will be read from the ```buildsPWDmatrix``` field of ```parameters.json```.

```
"flux_min": 10, # maximum flux allowed for 2D
"flux_min_3D": 4000,# maximum flux allowed for 3D
```



**Output images**

*Barcode localization statistics*

- `_filtered_barcode_localizations_ROI*.png`

This provides  localization statistics from ASTROPY. The main use of these plots is to determine if the threshold ```flux``` used is correct. Default is *200*.

In addition, this image displays  scatter plots of the flux of each barcode, its sharpness, magnitude and roundness. These are used in order to validate the segmentation process and help with the selection of the ```flux``` threshold used in this filtering step.
