# Overview

## High level view

*pyHiM* software is running as a pipeline, executing sequentially a series of pre-defined routines.
These routines can be classified into 5 groups:

1. **Preprocessing:** Organization and formatting of the input data before proceeding with the analysis (e.g. registration or calculation of 2D projection).
2. **Identification:** Image segmentation (e.g. detection of FISH spots, segmentation of nuclei or cells, etc.) and calculation of the 3D-coordinates.
3. **Matching:** Addressing each detection to a unique mask.
4. **Postprocessing:** Formatting output data to make post-analysis easier for the user (ex: pairwise distance matrices).
5. **Visualization:** Indicating live-progress and results to the user (as `.png` images and `.md` file).

```{note}
Each step can be optimized with **parallel computations** thanks to [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) package.
To use it, see [`--threads` argument](../getting_started/typical_run.md#optional-arguments).
```

## Data set

To run the default pipeline, *pyHiM* needs two types of data:
- A dictionary of initialization parameters, named `parameters.json`
- 3D images in TIFF format (extension: `.tif` or `.tiff`). 

Four types of images are accepted and will be processed in the following order:
1. **Fiducial**
2. **Barcode**
3. **Mask** (like DAPI)
4. RNA (optional)

```{note}
These types of images are called labels.
**Labels 1,2 & 3 are mandatory for running the default analysis pipeline.**
```

## Default *pyHiM* flow

The default pipeline is composed of the following routines:

1. [**project:**](modules/preprocessing/make_projections.md) Projects all 3D images in 2D.
2. [**register_global:**](modules/preprocessing/align_images.md) Computes the best shift to align all 2D fiducials. And (modules/preprocessing/applies_registrations.md) shifts 2D barcodes, masks and RNA according to the transformation computed at the `register_global` step.
3. [**register_local:**](modules/preprocessing/align_images_3d.md) Takes 2D aligned fiducial images and finds the best shift along the Z-axis. This shift will be applied on the 3D segmented barcodes at `register_localizations` step.
4. [**mask_2d:**](modules/identification/segment_masks.md) Segments 2D aligned masks.
5. [**localize_2d:**](modules/identification/segment_masks.md) Segments 2D aligned barcodes.
6. [**mask_3d:**](modules/identification/segment_masks_3d.md) Segments masks in 3D.
7. [**localize_3d:**](modules/identification/segment_sources_3d.md) Applies 2D shift, computed at `register_global` step, to 3D barcodes. Then segments them in 3D.
8. [**filter_localizations:**](modules/building_traces/filter_localizations.md) Filters the localizations in 2D and 3D.
9. [**register_localizations:**](modules/building_traces/register_localizations.md) Registers the 3D localizations with the local shifts.
10. [**build_traces:**](modules/building_traces/build_traces.md) Associates barcode coordinates with the relevant mask.
11. [**build_matrix:**](modules/building_traces/build_matrices.md) Calculates the pairwise distance (PWD) matrix for each trace.
