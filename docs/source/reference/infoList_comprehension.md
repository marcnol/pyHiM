# Input parameters
*infoList.json file*

## Global structure

Each section in `common` represents a step of pyHiM processing. Parameters are defined by default in `common` in their corresponding sections. If you want to change a parameter just for one channel, go to `labels` and you can overwrite the parameter value in the channel of your choice (an example [here](https://pyhim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/tutorials/configuration_file.html#manually)).
